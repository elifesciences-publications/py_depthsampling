VTK depth samling across subjects.

Visualise cortical depth sampling results from vtk files. Vertices are selected
according to several criteria:

    (1) Selection criterion 1 - the vertex has to be contained within the ROI
        (as defined by by a csv file containing the indices of the ROI
        vertices; this csv file can be created with paraview based on a
        retinotopic map).
    (2) Selection criterion 2 -  vertices that are BELOW threshold at any depth
        levels are excluded. (For example, a venogram, or a T2* weighted EPI
        image with low intensities around veins that is defined at all depth
        level can be used.)
    (3) Selection criterion 3 - same as (2). Vertices that are BELOW threshold
        at any depth level are excluded.
    (4) Selection criterion 4 - Vertices that are WITHIN INTERVAL are included
        (one depth level, e.g. retinotopic eccentricity).
